    <h2>Erik Tomlinson</h2>

    <p>My name is Erik. I have a wife and a cat. My wife and I have been married for 2 years. We enjoy playing games, roller blading, and skiing.</p>
    <p>I've been playing guitar and bass guitar for about 17 years, and more recently started dabbling with drums and vocals. Before COVID, I was playing gigs, so I am looking forward to getting back to that. In the mean time, I enjoy recording demos for my bands.</p>
